<h1>Who am I?</h1>
<p>I am a human from this here beautiful blue planet called Earth.</p>
Earth is located in an arm of the Milky Way galaxy, in a system we call the Solar system. 
Earth is the third planet from the system's only star called Sol or the Sun</p>
<p>As a human on this planet, I like to learn new things.  Learning is very important to humans.  My latest endeavour is to learn more about UI/UX and webdesign is my first foray into that world.  </p>
